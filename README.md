## Help
File Converter is a tool that can convert a file from one format to another.
For example, it can convert images from PNG to JPEG or audio from OGG to MP3. Send the file as an attachment to start conversion.
Supported attachment types: **photo**, **video**, **audio**, **voice**, **document**, and **sticker**.
Supported image formats: **JPEG**, **PNG**, **GIF**, **BMP**, **TIFF**, **WEBP** (not animated).
Supported audio formats: **MP3**, **WMA**, **WAV**, **OGG** (Opus and Vorbis), **FLAC**, **AAC**, **AIFF**, **AMR**.
Supported video formats: **MPEG4**, **MPEG**, **AVI**, **WMV**, **MOV**, **FLV**, **MKV**.
Max input file size is **20MB**, max output file size is **50MB**.

**Note 1:** Telegram may perform automatic file conversions to uploaded files (e.g. converting GIF to MP4,
or cropping video resolution).
Consider sending your files as \"files\" instead of \"media\" to avoid it.

**Note 2:** The conversion process may take a while, so please be patient.

**Why does one need to convert files from one format to another?**
1. <i>Efficient data storage.</i> Converting from uncompressed format (such as PNG or WAV) to lossy format (such as JPEG or MP3)
can significantly shrink the file size.
2. <i>Overcoming software limitations.</i> Users may face files unsupported by their software environment (e.g. iOS and OS X
cannot play OGG audio out-of-the-box
